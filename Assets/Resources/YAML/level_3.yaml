       - "Unfortunately, the spell is irreparably damaged."
       - "You notice another spell on the other side of the scroll.\nAccording to the author, it's a failed attempt at creating a magical discoball by opening a small portal to the laser dimension."
       - "Well... this won't be of much use at the next party, but you could do some serious damage with this spell."
